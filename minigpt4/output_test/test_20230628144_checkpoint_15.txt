claudins form tight tetrameric pores that facilitate the transmigration of solutes across the blood-brain barrier and the blood-brain/cerebrospinal fluid barrier claudins form a family of tight-junctions tjs that are specialized in selective permeability in general, the barrier properties of claudins are determined by their structural properties, as
Because cell membrane-spanning claudins form tight-junctions tjs at cell-cell boundaries, their composition, structure, and arrangement have been expected to provide a molecular filter that selectively permeates specific solutes while excluding others to examine claudin function in detail, we have studied claudin-4 in the blood-brain barrier and in mammalian brain here we show
Both directly and indirectly through their interactions with other tight-junction components, claudins play a central role in the selective permeability of the blood-brain barrier and the blood-brain/cerebrospinal fluid barrier claudins form tetramers with each other, but it is generally believed that they do not associate in higher-order oligomers in contrast, we show that claudin-4
